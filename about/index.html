<h1>About Niladri</h1>

<p>Niladri has spent the last 10 years in live events of all forms, producing concert, weddings, and DJ events for audiences of all sizes. 
Simultaneously he has been working with children, finding creative and innovative ways to teach difficult concepts.
Until, he finally thought why not combine the skills of teaching and live events and become a developer.
